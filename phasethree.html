    <h2>An Insight, Part 2</h2> 
    <p> This Phase is dedicated to reviewing the animators' work on some scenes. </p>

<h2 style="background-color:steelBlue;"> I have scoured the Internet <br>and I think that these videos<br> sum up perfectly how the movie was made.<br> Take a look! </h2>

Below me is some information you can know prior to watching the videos!
</span><br>

The second video is longer than the first one. <br>
The first video is made by a normal YouTube channel but features quotes and tips from the team in various interviews while the other video features the animators behind the movie talking. <br>
<br>

<p id="intro-line" align="center"> <span class="badge badge-info badge-pill"> 
Some statistics for the movie: </span><br>
	The movie, at one point, had 177 animators on staff. To put that in retrospect, the original Toy Story had 27 animators. <br>
	It took the animators one week to get just one second of footage. usually, it takesd about one week to get 4 seconds for footage. <br>
	The animators were so particular about the style of the movie, it took one year to get just ten seconds of footage they were happy with. <br>
	The movie has a 2 - 3 times higher shot count than any other animated film. <br>
