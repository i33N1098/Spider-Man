  <br>
  Enter Miles Morales, A 14-year-old teenager who is dressing up to go to a prestigious school, Brooklyn Visions Academy, after "winning that dumb lottery". After a montage with stressful lessons, it is clear that Miles is trying to quit, although he aces every single test. He enters a class late and tries to make a joke out of it, which is only laughed at by Gwen Stacy. They talk to each other and Miles senses some chemistry between them. That night, instead of returning to his dormitory, he visits his uncle Aaron, who says that he should use a tactic called the "shoulder touch". After that, he suggests following him to an abandoned subway track where he could throw up some of his graffiti. Miles agrees and off they go. While Miles is busy vandalising the wall with Uncle Aaron, we see a "glitching spider" creeping along the wall, marked with the number "42" and an Alchemax symbol on it, and glowing legs. The spider crawls up Miles leg, up to his hand. When Miles stops to take a picture of the graffiti, the spider bites him, releasing toxins into his bloodstream, turning his red blood cells blue, and causing the cells to multiply rapidly. After the bite, the spider is left drained and is slapped off of Miles' hand. <br>

  <br> <br>
  Miles meets Gwen in the Visions Academy hallway, causing him to try out the shoulder touch. However, the spider bite gave him spider powers, and Miles' hand sticks to Gwen's hair. he tries in vain to get it off, and the hair has to be shaved off by Gwen. Feeling embarrassed, Miles leaves the room, but shortly after gets shouted at by a security guard, who claims that he knows that Miles snuck out the previous night, which causes Miles to run away from him. Looking around for somewhere to hide, he chooses the closest room, which happened to be the security guard's office. Freaking out, Miles somehow manages to take off his shirt and shoes, and falls out of the window. But, due to his spider powers and lack of shoes, his feet stick to the wall. Meanwhile, Gwen sees Miles walking on the wall, and figures something out. Miles manages to stumble into his room through the window, causing a comic named "The True Life Tales Of Spider-Man" to fall on his face. Upon closer inspection, he sees that the experiences Spider-Man went through are the same as the ones he just went through.

  If you want more story, you're going to have to watch the movie yourself. Sorry!
  <br>
  <br>
  However, I <strong> can </strong> tell you the rest of the story put simply:

  <br>
  <br>

  He bumps into Alternate Universe Spider-Man while mourning Spider-Man's death. <br> <br>

  While trying to download an override key from an Alchemax facility, they meet Gwen Stacy, who is actually from another dimension, dressed as Spider-Woman, or Spider-Gwen. <br> <br>

  They go to Aunt May's house and enters the secret basement where Spider-Man used to keep his gear, and there they find three more Spider-People:
  <br>
  Spider-Ham, <br>
  Spider-Man Noir, <br>
  and Peni Parker.<br>
  <br>

Together, they test Miles' abilities, which there aren't many of. <br> <br>

They ultimately reject Miles and leave him while they leave to stop the collider from opening a black hole under Brooklyn. <br> <br>

Miles' father shows up at the door and gives a heartwarming speech which gives Miles the motivation to break out of his comfort zone and embrace himself as Spider-Man. <br> <br>

Miles steals the override key from Spider-Man and returns everyone to their respective dimensions. <br> <br>

Miles goes head to head with the Kingpin, and wins by using the "shoulder touch" and sending an electric shock through him. <br> <br>
